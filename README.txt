Expirimental implementation of "Conway's Game of Life", in JavaScript.

You can view this in a JSFiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/nnordhaus/1v18fog6/4/

Why the game of life?  

  It is a fairly simple concept to start with, but can lead to many types of expirimentation.

Why JavaScript?

  JavaScript is probably the most universal and lowest barrier to entry language to do a project.  It can be run in a browser without the need for a webserver.
